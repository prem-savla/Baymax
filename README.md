# Baymax
A modular, multi-node blockchain prototype for **federated learning**. Nodes communicate over TCP sockets, use cryptographic hashing &amp; signatures, and run a BFT-inspired voting flow to agree on **model update blocks**. Designed for ML workflows (e.g., Keras weights), but flexible enough for custom payloads.
